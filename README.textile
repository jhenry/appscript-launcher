h1. Appscript Launcher

This application bundle provides an application that allows the launching, via URL protocol, of arbitrary scripts within a specified directory within the ~/Library/Application\ Support/Appscripts/ directory.  It is intended for those using rb-appscript tool, but it will launch any ruby script.

h2. Installation

# Download and install wherever appropriate.  I'd reccommend putting it somewhere like ~/Applications/.  
# Create an "Appscript" directory in ~/Library/Application\ Support/

... or modify the application's AppleScript Source in Contents/Resources/Scripts to launch whatever you want.  Protocol can be changed in Contents/Info.plist. 

h2. Usage

Place the script you want to use in  ~/Library/Application\ Support/Appscript/, as such:

bq. ~/Library/Application\ Support/Appscripts/make_coffee.rb

Build a URL to launch the script, passing whatever arguments into the URL as you need:

bq. appscript://com.greengaloshes.AppleScript.AppscriptLauncher?run=make_coffee.rb&kind=sumatran&roast=dark
